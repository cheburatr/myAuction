myAuction is my test Spring Boot application using Quartz for job scheduling, Thymeleaf for client side implementation, JUnit 5 and MockMVC for testing. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store data.

Before you start:
1) install PostgreSQL
2) create DB "my_auction" with default Quartz schema for postgre
